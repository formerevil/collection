        California has a problem with air pollution, especially in the San Joaquin Valley. According to Earth.org’s article “Air Pollution in California,” California has some of the worst cities in terms of both daily and year-round particle pollution.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because of the pollution, 40% of which is from transportation, about 1 in 4 children suffer from asthma in the San Joaquin Valley of California. As someone who was born and raised in Fresno, California, I have met many people with asthma and I, myself, have suffered from Reactive Airway Disease, which refers to respiratory diseases including asthma. I have seen firsthand the effects of air pollution in our valley.
        The central valley also had a PM2.5 concentration of “over 200% the national average” in 2021, according to the Fresno Bee’s article “EPA tightens standard on San Joaquin Valley’s deadliest air pollutant. Can regulators meet it?” The hazardous pollutant PM2.5 attacks every organ in the human body and kills more people locally than car accidents every year. This is made worse by the fact that California has a problem with car accidents. There were 3,438 crashes in 2019 that resulted in death, state the California Highway Patrol. Not only do cars contribute to the problem of our highly polluted Central Valley, they also threaten and end thousands of lives every year.
    </p>
    <p>
        PM2.5 comes from cars and trucks, especially diesels, according to the California Air Resources Board. Motor vehicles are the single largest source of carbon monoxide emissions.
        “Nationwide, cars and trucks contribute to more than 50% of all emissions”, according to the Environmental Health page of Los Angeles Department of Public Health. Since cars are the problem, banning them would be the solution. To our credit, California has moved to ban the sale of new gasoline powered cars, but in order to address the health and safety of Californians, specifically children living in the San Joaquin Valley, California needs to strictly limit the use of cars and trucks, especially diesel vehicles.

    </p>
    <p>
        Since we are so reliant on cars in this day and age, how can we find a middle ground? First of all, carpooling can be a safer, greener option for those who cannot reliably walk or bike to where they need to go.
        Generally, carpoolers are safer drivers and carpooling can reduce the carbon footprint of a household by 1 ton of CO2e annually, when compared to vehicles with only one occupant. Carpooling with strangers can be risky, but driving with trusted companies and loved ones can increase your road safety and help the environment.
        So, if you live in California think about the outcomes and options before you go on that drive. If possible, aim to reduce your use of diesel vehicles and discuss carpooling with your loved ones. For the health and safety of California, we, as California residents, should try to reduce our carbon emissions and reduce our reliance on our cars one step at a time.
