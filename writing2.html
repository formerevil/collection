  <p>
    The author of Hidden Intellectualism, Gerald Graff, writes that intellectualism is not, in fact, simply discussing academic topics, it is discussing topics through an academic lens.
    Graff, throughout his essay, explains that an academic discussion of a subject is not limited to so called academic subjects, rather, that it requires the writer to be interested in the topic and must be dissected within an academic framework.
  </p>
  <p>
    Gerald Graff writes that in order to get students invested in academic discussions, the subject needs to grab their attention and the students need to overcome the boredom and alienation that he sees as affecting their writing.Gerald Graff writes that in order to get students invested in academic discussions, the subject needs to grab their attention and the students need to overcome the boredom and alienation that he sees as affecting their writing.
    Graff claims that schools are not only missing out but are also cheating students by discouraging students from writing about nonacademic subjects like sports, magazines, fashion, and other such topics. He calls this discouragement “self-defeating” as it cheats the schools as well as depriving the students from engaging in important thinking.
    This is interesting to me because the conversation around student writing is usually about student choices.
  </p>
  <p>
    This focus on the effects on the schools and school systems stands out in a way that I find refreshing but also confusing. Reframing in this way detracts from the effects on students, in my opinion.
    Why should we focus on the loss of the schools when, really, these decisions deprive students and affect their futures? If young people don’t learn how to analyze subjects academically in school, it is possible that they will never learn.
    At least, they won’t learn how to use specific academic tools in discussions. Furthermore, students’ learning is diminished while they are in school. They learn that academia is boring and exclusive, when intellectualism should be accessible to everyone who has the ability to write about or discuss a topic.

  </p>
  <p>
    Graff follows his argument that intellectualism should be extended past “inherently” academic topics with the claim that there is “no necessary relation between the degree of interest a student shows in a text or subject and the quality of thought or expression such a student manifests in writing or talking about it.”
    .” By this he means that even if a student is engaged in the subject that they are writing about, it does not necessarily mean it will be an academic reading of the subject.
    . I agree with this sentiment. Nearly anyone can engage in an academic discussion, but most people don’t have the tools necessary.
    . It is important to be interested in the topic, but interest without a framework or method is useless in academic writing. As Graff describes, we need to overcome the hurdles of boredom and alienation but also move closer to an academically rigorous treatment of the subjects.

  </p>
  <p>
    While I agree with what the author says about intellectualism by other means, I believe we should go further into this argument. I think what we deem unacademic is not only subjective, but outdated and useless.
  </p>
  <p>
    What does it mean for a subject to be academic? What distinguishes a discussion about Socrates’ writings from a discussion about Stephen King’s?
    In my opinion, schools should not only allow students to write about nonacademic subjects, but our general culture should reframe what an “academic subject” means.
    Not only are schools missing out when depriving students of the opportunity to discuss their preferred topics, but the world as a whole misses out on the analytical perspectives that are usually dismissed. An intellectual dialogue about fashion and culture should not be dismissed over a discussion of physics and mathematics.
    It should not be discredited if, as Gerald Graff puts it, “one sees them as microcosms of what is going on in the wider culture.” This is to say that to analyze through academic eyes is to frame the topics within the bigger picture.
  </p>
  <p>
    Many subjects that are deemed nonacademic are seen that way because of the people who talk about them.
    For example, the fashion demographic mainly consists of women, and often, subjects that interest women are deemed as less sophisticated than subjects that mainly interest men.
  </p>
<p>
  In his essay, Gerald Graff touches on the difference between the “clean-cut” boys and “hoods” in the neighborhood he grew up in in Chicago.
  He explains that one side prided itself on being smart or “bookish,” while the other side was notably anti-intellectual. Graff concludes that he and his anti-intellectual friends were, in fact, participating in intellectual discussions of toughness and sports.
  . It is important to iterate that the classification of intellectual versus non-intellectual subjects often has some bias.
  Often prejudices related to gender, race, ethnicity, or class make people see things like sports as nonacademic while viewing subjects like Orwellian and Shakespearean writing as academic.
  . Sports and toughness are deemed unintellectual subject matters but, as Graff puts it, he and his friends had practiced academic analysis while discussing these nonacademic subjects. I believe we should throw out our ideas of intellectualism. These ideas, often stemming from biases, discourage students who could become invested in intellectual discussions and cause exclusion of so called “anti-intellectuals.”

</p>
  <p>
    What is the point of the distinction between academic and nonacademic topics? In the case of education, it can be said that it is better to teach with “academic” writings but, as Graff reiterates, the restrictions on students to write strictly about academic subjects can do more harm to learning than if students were allowed to write about “nonacademic” topics.
    So, if not for education, is this division important in general life? In my opinion, no. Deciding that certain topics are anti-intellectual while others are sophisticated does more harm than good.
    . Often, the split between academic and nonacademic discussions outside of a school setting is used to tear down certain demographics, like women who like television, or people of color who like discussing sports, or queer people who talk about fashion.
    People who discuss “academic” topics like technology and philosophy tend to look down on people they deem anti-intellectual without considering that the discussions occurring in these circles could be more academic than their own analyses. All this is, in my opinion, because of our cultural ideas of intellectualism and academics.

  </p>
  <p>
    Throughout his essay, I feel that Graff fails to go into depth about the way students feel alienated and disinterested during academic discussions or analysis.
    This, in particular, should be blamed on the schooling system in my opinion. I believe schools should do better to engage students and teach intellectual strategies rather than enforce the binary between academic and nonacademic readings.
    If we can “see through academic eyes” as Graff says, we should not be limited to a select range of topics. As a student, I have seen firsthand the difference when curriculums leave room for student curiosity versus when they restrict students’ choices.
    In high school, all students are beginners when it comes to intelligent discussions. However, there is a noticeable improvement in the presentation and dissection of topics that personally interest the students versus when the students are obviously bored of the subject matter. Students are more invested in the discussion and work harder to prove their points when they have some stake in the topic they are discussing.
    Even when students are not as invested in the topic they are writing about, the freedom to choose a topic that interests them means that they will be more willing to participate in the analysis. Graph himself claims that he would rather a student who “writes a sharply argued, sociologically acute analysis of an issue in Source over the student who writes a lifeless explication of Hamlet or Socrates’ Apology.”
